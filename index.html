        <p>I was born and raised in Philadelphia, PA -- Go E-A-G-L-E-S! I am a Mom and wife of 3 girls. I also had a son who passed away in 2009 at 6 months-old from
        <a href="https://safetosleep.nichd.nih.gov/safesleepbasics/SIDS"title="Safe to Sleep - U.S. Department of Health and Human Services">SIDS</a>. We miss him dearly.
         In 2011 my family moved to Atlanta, GA 2011 and we have been living here for 9 years now and we love it here! 
         In spite of experiencing 2 life-changing events in my life of losing a child to SIDS and battling Hodgkin's 
         Lymphoma cancer in 2013; I still continue to persevere and I am determined to meet my goals and dreams.<br>
         My professional work experience has mostly been as a Administrative Assistant and I have 15+ years of experience working in that career.
         But, in January of 2018 I decided to embark on a journey of learning how to code. I attended a coding workshop and realized that 
         coding wasnâ€™t as hard as I thought.  I started searching online all about coding and listening to coding podcasts. I bought a 
         course on Udemy and started learning HTML and CSS. I also started learning on Team Treehouse and really started loving the creative
         aspect of coding. I loved writing a piece of code and then refreshing my browser and seeing how the webpage would change and feeling 
         great that I did that!<br> 
         
         My goal moving forward is to become a Software Engineer, to accept a position with a great company that aligns with my values, 
         and use my knowledge and platform to teach coding to the youth in my neighborhood.<br> 
         I realized that I really needed to be in a structured program to remain consistent, so I applied to DigitalCrafts and I was accepted 
         into their Full Stack Flex program. I am so excited and can't wait to start pursing a career as a Software Engineer. What will motivate me to keep going is 
         remembering "My Why"!</p>
